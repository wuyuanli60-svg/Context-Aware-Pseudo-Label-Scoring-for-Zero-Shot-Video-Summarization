# Appendix A: Reason Mining Prompt

You will write THREE concrete reasons for this video and return STRICT JSON with the keys:
-- "reason_positive": one succinct but specific reason why the HIGH-score segments are key.
-- "reason_negative": one succinct but specific reason why the LOW-score segments are not key.
-- "reason_difference": one succinct but specific reason explaining their essential difference.

Writing requirements (light but important):
- Ground every reason in the provided descriptions (do not invent entities).
- Prefer concrete facts: WHO did WHAT action → WHAT outcome/visible change (before → after), and HOW this ties to the overall goal below.
- You may summarize across segments; do not list them one by one; do not include indices like TOPK[2] or LOWK[1].
- 2–4 sentences per reason; avoid boilerplate (e.g., “engaging/appealing/impactful” without saying how).

Input structure:
[VIDEO_ID]
{video identifier}
[GLOBAL DESCRIPTION]
{full video summary}
[HIGH-SCORE SEGMENTS]
{list of top segments with descriptions}
[LOW-SCORE SEGMENTS]
{list of low segments with descriptions}
[OPTIONAL CONTENT HINTS — HIGH]
{high_hints, if available}
[OPTIONAL CONTENT HINTS — LOW]
{low_hints, if available}

Return format:
Return ONLY JSON with the three keys shown above. No extra commentary or explanation.

Example output:
{
  "reason_positive": "The high-score scenes show direct human–animal interaction, clearly demonstrating the main task of grooming and feeding.",
  "reason_negative": "Low-score scenes depict static backgrounds or transitions without visible actions.",
  "reason_difference": "High segments contribute to narrative progress and interaction, while low ones serve only as filler or setup."
}
